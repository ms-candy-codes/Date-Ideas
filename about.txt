    To start off, I built this because yesterday I was super disappointed 
    when I couldn't find any long distance date ideas that were good.
    So I decided to take matters into my own hands. 
    My intention with this website is to give us ideas for future dates, 
    right now its more for long distance but as the gap closes I will
    update to in person dates. I also intend on updating the ideas monthly,
    hopefully we can come together with new ideas for each update.

    To end off, I want to say that I love you and I am extremely grateful for you Troy.
    I hope this little show of appreciation gives you a little glimpse into
    how much I love and adore you.
