        <p>To start off, I built this because yesterday I was super disappointed 
        when I couldn't find any long distance date ideas that were good.</p>
        <p>So I decided to take matters into my own hands.</p>
        <p>My intention with this website is to give us ideas for future dates, 
        right now its more for long distance but as the gap closes I will
        update to in person dates. I also intend on updating the ideas monthly,
        hopefully we can come together with new ideas for each update.</p>
        <p>To end off, I want to say that I love you and I am extremely grateful for you Troy.
        I hope this little show of appreciation gives you a glimpse into
        how much I love and adore you.</p>
